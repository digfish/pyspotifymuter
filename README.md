### PYSPOTIFTYMUTER

Muting Spotify ads under windows. This is a console application that runs forever until a Ctrl+C interrupts the infinite loop.

Reimplementation of the repository [spotify-blacklist-mute](https://github.com/digfish/spotify-blacklist-mute-windows) using Python. 
This version does not need Cygwin, the only requirements are a Python environment on Windows ( [python.org](http://python.org), [anaconda](http://anaconda.com), [ActivePython](https://www.activestate.com/products/activepython/), etc. ) and the [nircmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) tool (this last one must be on your PATH).

 To run it, open a cmd window and execute:
```cmd
 python muter.py
```
